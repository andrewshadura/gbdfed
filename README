XmBDFEditor 4.5

INTRO
-----

XmBDFEditor is a Motif-based BDF font editor with the following features:

  o  Multiple fonts can be loaded from the command line.
  o  Multiple fonts can be open at the same time.
  o  Cutting and pasting glyphs between fonts.
  o  Multiple glyph bitmap editors can be open at the same time.
  o  Cutting and pasting between glyph bitmap editors.
  o  Export of XBM files from glyph bitmap editors.
  o  Automatic correction of certain metrics when a font is loaded.
  o  Generation of XLFD font names for fonts without XLFD names.
  o  Update an XLFD font name from the font properties.
  o  Update the font properties from an XLFD font name.
  o  Font property editor.
  o  Font comment editor.
  o  Supports unencoded glyphs (ENCODING of -1).
  o  Display of glyph encodings in octal, decimal, or hex.
  o  Builtin on-line help.
  o  Imports PK/GF fonts.
  o  Imports HBF (Han Bitmap Font) fonts.
  o  Imports Linux console fonts (PSF, CP, and FNT).
  o  Imports Sun console fonts (vfont format).
  o  Imports fonts from the X server.
  o  Imports Windows FON/FNT fonts.
  o  Imports TrueType fonts and collections.
  o  Exports PSF fonts.
  o  Exports HEX fonts.
  o  Edits two and four bits per pixel gray scale fonts.

A few things missing from this font editor:

  o  Selecting a non-console font when importing a console font should
     autodetect by filename extension.
  o  No support for scaling fonts.
  o  No way to create space glyphs in monowidth or character cell fonts.
  o  Fonts with right-to-left direction (negative widths) not supported.
  o  Many more font properties could be automatically calculated.
  o  No way to edit comments appearing in the properties list.

Known problems:

  o  Text fields do not have horizontal scrollbars.  Some machines running
     X11R6 only have arrow keys on the keypad which earlier versions of Motif
     don't recognize.
  o  Deleting glyphs from or inserting glyphs into a font grid do not update
     the glyph editors if they happen to be editing a deleted glyph or a glyph
     that moved due to an insertion.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------
  xmbdfed [options] [font1 font2 ...]

  -nc     - do not preserve comments
  -nu     - do not preserve unencoded glyphs
  -nm     - do not make metrics corrections
  -np     - do not pad character-cell bitmaps
  -bp     - allow blank pages
  -ed     - do not present the "Really Exit?" dialog
  -ps n   - set default point size
  -hres n - set default horizontal resolution
  -vres n - set default vertical resolution
  -res n  - set both default resolutions
  -sp s   - set font spacing ("p" for proportional, "m" for monospace,
            or "c" for charcell).
  -bpp n  - set the font bits per pixel (1, 2, or 4).
  -eol e  - set the default end-of-line char(s) ("u" for Unix, "d" for DOS,
            or "m" for Mac).
  -g code - set the initial glyph code (in decimal, hex or octal).
  -pb     - turn off the progress bar.

  By default, xmbdfed will set its point size to 12, the horizontal and
  vertical resolution to that of the display (e.g. 90x90 dpi for Sun's), and
  the font spacing to proportional.  Also by default, xmbdfed will preserve
  comments, preserve unencoded glyphs, and make metrics corrections when
  loading fonts.  One bit per pixel is the default.

COMPILING
---------

To compile XmBDFEditor, you will need the following:

  Compiler     : ISO, Traditional C, or C++ compiler
  Window System: X11R5 or X11R6
  Toolkit      : Motif 1.2.* or 2.*

Optional:
  The FreeType and HBF import capabilities are optional.  To use them, you
  need to get copies from the following ftp sites:

  ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/fonts/utils/hbf.tar.gz [source code]
  ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/info/HBF-1.1.tar.gz    [docs optional]
  http://www.freetype.org

Step 0:
  For HBF support, copy the hbf.h and hbf.c files from the original sources
  into the current directory and apply the HBF.PATCH file using the patch
  program.

Step 1:
  Edit the Makefile to set the INCS and LIBS variables to point at the header
  file and library locations for X11 and Motif.

  Uncomment the FTYPE_* variables and edit FTYPE_INCS and FTYPE_LIBS to point
  to the locations of the FreeType header and library if FreeType is
  available.

  Uncomment the HBF_* variables if HBF support is available.

  Edit the HBFDEFS variable to set the correct OS and correct directory for
  the "gunzip" (GNU unzip) program.  If you do not have the "gunzip" program,
  simply comment this variable out, which will remove the HBF support for
  compressed glyph bitmap files.

Step 2:
  Build the program by typing "make".

WARNINGS
--------

1. When compiling on HP/UX, the htext.h file has long catenated strings that
   require the -H option (noted by W. Chao).
