From the getbdf code:

/*
 * getbdf - generate a BDF file from a font as accessed by an X
 *  connection.
 *
 * As its author, I explicitly place this program in the public domain;
 *  you may use it in any way for any purpose.  (I would appreciate
 *  credit where it's due....)
 *
 * I have tried to make sure that it does what it's supposed to, but I
 *  make no promises; if it causes something unpleasant to happen, it's
 *  your problem, not mine.  It's free, and you get what you pay for.
 *
 * Of course, I say that for legal reasons; I'd *am* interested in
 *  hearing what you think of getbdf.  In particular, if you think
 *  you've found something wrong with it, I definitely want to hear
 *  about it.
