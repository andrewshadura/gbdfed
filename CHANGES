     grabbing it with the mouse after it has been selected now works as
     expected.

  3. Made it clearer in the GlyphEditors that "Resize" means to resize the
     glyph bounding box, and not the glyph.  Also updated the documentation

     is saved.

  4. Changed the FontGrid so clicking the mouse outside the actual bounds of
     the drawn area does nothing.

  5. The glyph name is now updated immediately when a non-merging paste is
     done in the FontGrid.

  6. Changed things so that the last chosen operation in a GlyphEditor will
     remain the same operation even after it has been closed and opened
     again.

  7. Fixed a problem with merging glyphs.  Only the first glyph was being
     merged.

  8. Changed the GlyphEditors so the glyph name input field is the width of
     the editor.

  9. Added menu options to the FontGrids so glyphs can be merged (overlayed)
     or inserted instead of replacing glyphs when pasting.

  10. Added the ability to specify the initial glyph using the "-g" command
      line option.

  11. Changed so that when the program first comes up, an initial glyph is
      selected.  This was done to make keyboard navigation easier.

  12. Changed page navigation for empty fonts so all pages are available from
      the First, Last, Next, and Previous page buttons.

  13. Added the arrow keys to allow keyboard based navigation through the
      FontGrid pages.

  14. Added the Return key to be equivalent to double clicking on a cell in
      the FontGrid.

  15. Added ability to select glyphs using the keyboard using the Shift key
      combined with the arrow keys.

  16. Added the ability to turn the progress bar off and use a watch cursor
      instead for potentially long operations.

  17. Changed the page traversal code to move the cursor as well as the arrow
      buttons.

  18. Added the Ctrl+Shift+Return toggle to the GlyphEditors for drawing using
      the keyboard.

  19. Fixed a problem with setting the initial glyph when later fonts are
      loaded.

  20. Added code to make backups at save time which can be turned on or off
      from the Setup dialog or the .xmbdfedrc file.

  21. Improved the documentation.

  22. Fixed a problem with selecting a cell after a cut.

  23. Removed everything related to the _XFREE86_GLYPH_RANGES property.

  24. Fixed a problem with duplicate glyphs in the GlyphTest dialog.

  25. Fixed a bug in deleting glyphs when the range specified is in reverse.

  26. Some minor code cleanup.

     Duplicates are now moved to the unencoded area.

  2. Added the ability to rename glyphs from an Adobe glyph name file.

  3. Use symbolic constants rather than hex values for the GF and PK opcode
     bytes and added comments in bdfpkgf.c.

  4. When importing GF or PK fonts, recognise the "title " specials that
     gives a glyph's name, and save the name with the glyph, rather than
     adding it as a comment to the font as a whole.

  5. Fixed x_offset's sign when interpreting GF_boc1 data in a GF file.

  6. Fixed x_offset's sign when interpreting long glyph info in a PK file.

  7. Fixed an endian problem with importing .FON fonts.

     encoded displays.

  6. Added a mnemonic to the menu item that switches between the vertical and
     horizontal displays.

  7. Page and code numbers are cached when they are entered in the "Page" and
     "Code" fields so they can be accessed by the arrow keys.

  7. Added field to set the "name_file" parameter from the
     "Setup->Other Options" dialog.

  8. The cursor is always positioned at the end of the glyph name and device
     width fields in the GlyphEditors.

  9. Added "percent_only" to the xmbdfedrc file to toggle display of only the
     percentage on the progress bar.

  10. Added an option to turn off the progress bar updating except for the

Version 2.9
===========
  1. Fixed the incorrect version number in htext.h.

  2. Added compile lines for HP (donated by W. Chao).

  3. Changed things so HBF support is optional at compile time.

Version 2.8
===========
  1. Fixed the missing pixel size handling in the GlyphEditor widgets.

  2. Changed the exit routine to exit immediately instead of allowing Motif

  7. Fixed a problem when bad BDF fonts are specified on the command line.

Version 2.7
===========
  1. Fixed compilation warning messages in hbf.c.

  2. Changed the GlyphEditToolbox context help to erase the message
     after leaving the button.

  3. Fixed a bad margin spacing on the GlyphEdit widgets.

  4. Fixed it so the GlyphEdit widgets don't report coordinates if they
     are outside of the drawn grid.

  5. Changed the GlyphEdit widgets so they attempt to make the dot size
     as large as possible and remain within the bounds of 1/2 the screen
     size.  This ranges from 10x10 as the largest and 2x2 as the
     smallest.

  6. Fixed the XmFormWidget resize problem with the FontGrid's.

  7. Made the _MULE_BASELINE_OFFSET and _MULE_RELATIVE_COMPOSE properties

     Close/Exit accelerators on the FontGrids and GlyphEditors.

  3. Dramatically speeded up paging and some drawing in the FontGrids.

  4. Fixed a minor redraw problem on resizes.

  5. Removed the crop button from the GlyphEditToolbox because it is not
     needed any more.

  6. When the spacing in the font name is changed from Proportional to
     Monowidth or Character cell, the font's monowidth value is set to
     be the width of the font BBX.

  7. Fixed a problem with loading gzipped HBF fonts.

  8. Added the ability to repeat on the GlyphEditToolbox shift buttons by
     holding the mouse button down.

  9. Changed things so rotations and shears in the GlyphEditors will
     resize if necessary.

  10. Added a menu to the FontGrids to translate (Ctrl+D), rotate (Ctrl+R),
      and shear (Ctrl+J) the selected glyphs or all glyphs.

  11. Modified the GlyphEditors a bit to use the common rotate and shear
      dialogs.

  12. Fixed an allocation bug in the glyph grid resize function.

  13. Rotations and shears in the GlyphEditors now resize if the operation
      causes the glyph to get larger.

Version 2.5
===========
  1. Fixed some of the rounding errors with glyph rotations.

  2. Fixed a problem with updating the average width in the font name.

  3. Added a new user-defined property of _ORIGINAL_FONT_NAME to use when
     XLFD names are generated.  The old way of storing the original font
     name in the FONT property causes some versions of "mkfontdir" to use
     that property value as the font name instead of the expected value.

  4. Changed the FontGrid so generating XLFD names saves the original name
     in the _ORIGINAL_FONT_NAME property.

  5. Removed support for loading HBF fonts from the command line because
     they can be imported instead.

  6. Changed includes around so bdf.h includes all the needed headers.

  7. Added the ability to import TrueType fonts using the FreeType renderer
     if it is available on the system.  The accelerator for this is Ctrl+Y.

  8. Changed all the "rcsid" variables a bit so no compilation warnings are
     issued.

  9. Updated the help text a bit with a short section on the TT fonts and
     updated the man page.

  10. Fixed a memory leak in the TT open dialog.

  11. Update the Lesstif Imakefile.  Do not know if it works yet.

  12. Fixed a simple problem with padding glyph cells.

  13. Fixed an old problem with importing "codepage" console fonts and
      changed the progress bar so it does not show up 3 times.

Version 2.4
===========
  1. Fixed a rare problem when selecting cells in the FontGrid.

  2. Fixed a redraw problem in the glyph editors that would sometimes
     not allow glyphs to be redrawn.

  3. Fixed an accelerator in the glyph editors that was conflicting with
     exporting XBMs.

  4. Fixed a problem with selecting empty FontGrid cells that was causing
     core dumps.

  5. Changed the glyph editors to use a top level shell instead of a dialog
     shell so they remain visible when the first FontGrid is iconified.

  6. Changed things so glyph editors will be closed when their associated
     FontGrids are closed.  If the glyph is modified, a save dialog is
     presented first.

  7. When a FontGrid other than the first FontGrid is being closed, a
     save dialog will be presented if the FontGrid was modified.

  8. Changed the test dialog so it will not be iconified with the first
     FontGrid.

  9. Changed the test dialog to make the Baseline a toggle button and
     added a Right To Left toggle button.

  10. Modified the GlyphTest widget to allow display of glyphs from right
      to left as well as left to right.

  12. All open glyph editors area closed before exiting now so the chance
      to update glyphs before exiting is given.

  13. Changed the GlyphEditToolbar so it does not gain or lose focus.  This
      allows the glyph bitmap widget to keep the focus.

  14. Fixed a focus problem when a GlyphEditor is popped up.  The glyph
      bitmap widget was not getting the focus when the GlyphEditors are
      popped up.

  15. Changed the resize dialog to be a child of the GlyphEditor it was
      created from so it gets iconified when the GlyphEditor is iconified.

  16. Generalized the glyph rotation function so glyphs can be rotated to
      any angle.

  17. Added a function to shear (oblique or slant) glyphs to bdfgrid.c.

  18. Added a dialog to the GlyphEditors to specify the number of degrees
      to rotate or shear.

  19. Modified the GlyphEditToolbox to include buttons for shearing and
      general rotating.

  20. Added an Edit menu option to reload the current glyph if the changes
      are not what is wanted.

Version 2.3
===========
  1. Fixed a problem with the progress bar not popping down when a
     mismatch occurs between the reported and actual number of
     characters.

  2. Fixed a problem with padding character cell fonts.

  3. Fixed a problem with the test widget using the device width of the
     glyphs instead of the actual width, which is what the X11 drawing
     routines use.

  4. Changed the progress bar to work more like people expect.

  5. Changed the FontGrids so they report Button1Down always so the test
     widget will get a selected glyph report.

  6. Changed the shortcut key for copying in the Glyph Editors to Ctrl+Y
     to get rid of the conflict with exporting XBMs from the Glyph
     Editors.

  7. Changed the glyph test dialog so it allows testing glyphs from
     different fonts together.  The glph test dialog will now expand to
     allow as many glyphs as are wanted.

  8. Fixed a problem that caused the font grid to be redrawn
     incorrectly when a Glyph Editor updated the font metrics.

  9. Fixed a problem with the Font Grids attempting to draw glyphs off
     the current page when they are updated from a Glyph Editor.

  10. Fixed a problem with a certain set of button clicks in the Font
      Grid causing a crash.

  11. Fixed a problem with the Glyph Editor not redrawing when a glyph
      changes.

  12. Generalized the glyph rotation routine so any angle can be used.

Version 2.2
===========
  1. Fixed a minor memory leak when importing XBM files.

  2. Added XBM export capability from the glyph editors.

  3. Added code to update font fields when the RESOLUTION_* and POINT_SIZE
     properties are set.

  4. Added a "Font Info" menu option to the "Edit" menu on the font grids to
     allow users to modify certain values in one place instead of modifying
     the properties and then updating the font name.

  5. The bdf_add_font_property() function now marks the font modified when
     a property is added or changed.

  6. Fixed a nasty bug with padding glyph cells when writing fonts.

  7. Fixed a problem with pixel size calculations when creating new fonts.

  8. Loading console fonts now causes many of the XLFD properties to be
     defined.

  9. Fixed a metrics calculation problem with Sun VF fonts.

  10. Loading Sun VF fonts now defaults to proportional and is changed to
      monospace if all the glyph metrics are the same.

  11. Fixed the progress bar so it displays for fonts of any size.

  12. Changed things around so the save question dialog is called before
      instead of after, the dialog for grabbing a server font is shown.

  13. Fixed a display problem with the glyph encoding when the base of the
      glyph encoding values was changed.

  14. Importing console fonts now adds a font comment about being converted
      into BDF format.

  15. Added import capability for Metafont PK and GF fonts.

  16. Fixed a minor problem with a missing config option when the setup is
      written out after being changed.

  17. Fixed a problem with crashes caused by invalid page numbers entered in
      the "Page:" field.

  18. Fixed a minor selection problem when pasting glyphs into the unencoded
      area.

  19. Fixed things so any glyphs pasted into a font grid that would be
      encoded after 0xffff now get moved into the unencoded area so the
      overflow glyphs are not lost.

  20. Added a new binding (Shift+Button2) to the font grids to allow pastes
      that insert glyphs instead of overwriting.  Glyphs that get moved off
      the end of the font are put in the unencoded area.

  21. Added the ability to toggle insert/overwrite mode to the Setup dialog.
      This toggle only affects the font grid where the Setup dialog was
      started.

Version 2.1
===========
  1. Added a callback to the grab font selection text field so hitting return
     in it will cause the font to be loaded.

  2. Fixed a minor problem with HBF font names that would leak old names and
     sometimes overwrite new names.

  3. Changed the font grids to use NorthWest bit gravity and save under to
     speed up the grid refreshing, particularly on slow machines and fonts
     with large glyphs.

  4. Changed the font grid to add extra highlighting to the encoding label box
     to indicate which glyphs are actually defined.  This lets the user know
     that a glyph cell that might look empty, actually has a blank glyph.

  5. Fixed a problem with fonts grabbed from the X server missing the
     DEFAULT_CHAR field in some cases.

  6. Changed things a little in the font name pattern to avoid extra entries
     being added by the call the XListFonts().

  7. Fixed a problem with monospace fonts changed to character cell fonts with
     negative X or Y offset glyphs.

  8. Greatly improved the speed of writing character cell fonts and fixed a
     related malloc/free problem that would crash systems with buggy heap
     memory management.

  9. Fixed a geometry problem with the ProgressBar widget that would show up
     with long labels.

  10. Changed so importing console fonts adds an edit message about the
      conversion.

  11. Added Ctrl+I to the glyph editors to allow inserting X Bitmaps
      (XBM files).

  12. Fixed the glyph editors so they resize to fit bitmaps larger than the
      grid when bitmaps are pasted or inserted.

  13. Some very minor improvements in the on-line help text and the manual
      page.

Version 2.0
===========
  1. Fixed a problem with the "Encoded/Unencoded" View menu item not being
     reset to "Unencoded" when a new font is loaded into a Font Grid.

  2. Fixed a long-standing problem with the Ctrl+A Select All option in the
     Glyph Editors.  The selection would work, but copying or cutting to the
     clipboard would not.

  3. Fixed a problem with the Font Grid selection mechanism that was not
     allowing a reset when the mouse was clicked in two different cells within
     the time limit allowed for double clicks.

  4. Added "RAW_PIXELSIZE" and "RAW_POINTSIZE" back in because some versions
     of X11R6.1 seem to produce them at random from calls to XGetAtomName().

  5. Fixed things so that FONT_ASCENT and FONT_DESCENT are defined for
     all imported fonts.  Pointed out by Michal Szymanski.

  6. Fixed a problem with character cell and monowidth fonts imported from the
     X server not having their overall width set.  Pointed out by Michal
     Szymanski.

  7. Fixed a problem with the first field of the SIZE line not being divided
     by 10 before being saved.  Pointed out by Michal Szymanski.

  8. Fixed the routine that generates the initial XLFD name so it pays
     attention to existing font properties.

  9. Changed the HBF import code to generate an XLFD name as the initial
     name.

Version 1.9
===========
  1. Fixed a bug with the GC used for clearing when grabbing a font from
     the server.  Pointed out by Mike Stroyan.

  2. Fixed invalid RAW_POINTSIZE and RAW_PIXELSIZE property names.  Pointed
     out by Mike Stroyan.

  3. Fixed a bug with rotating glyph bitmaps that filled up most of the grid.
     Pointed out by Werner Lemberg.

  4. Fixed a bug with the progress bar not popping down when loading/saving
     fonts with less than about 256 small glyphs.

  5. Changed things so little endian architectures are automatically
     detected.

  6. Fixed a minor assignment bug that did not really affect anything.

  7. Added an "Import" menu for importing fonts in various formats. The "Grab"
     menu item has been replaced with an entry on the Import menu, but still
     has the same accelerator.

  8. Support for importing console fonts from Linux and Sun added.

  9. Fixed a save problem for fonts that have no character names.

Version 1.8
===========
  1. The Ctrl+Z accelerator now toggles the glyph test dialog on or off.

  2. Fixed a bug with certain config file options not being set.

  3. Changing the Device Width for character cell and monospace fonts was not
     updating the font modified flag or the glyph test dialog if it was up.

  4. The glyph test widget was using the wrong width for non-proportional
     fonts.

  5. Comments in HBF fonts that appeared before the HBF_START_FONT line were
     causing crashes.

  6. Added a feature to the glyph test dialog to toggle the baseline on and
     off.

  7. Updated Imakefile.lesstif provided by Werner Lemberg.

Version 1.7
===========
  1. Fix for a font name list deallocation bug and a memory leak in grab.c
     provided by Mike Stroyan.

  2. Imakefile for LessTif provided by Danny Backx.

  3. Added progress bar when loading and saving fonts.

  4. Fix for some missing backslashes in htext.h provided by Donald Page.

  5. Removed the code that made the unencoded area unavailable when a font is
     grabbed from the server.

  6. Added better error checking when loading fonts.

  7. Added a progress bar to indicate the progress of a load or save.

  8. Fixed a problem in hbf.c that caused a file open on every HBF_CODE_RANGE
     line.  Pointed out by Werner Lemberg.

  9. Changed the MainWindow manager widget from a RowColumn to a Form to avoid
     RowColumn wierdness.

  10. Added much better error handling for corrupted fonts, but still needs
      some improvement.

  11. Fixed up the glyph info label so it is two lines.  This was done for
      glyphs with very long names.

  12. Fixed a selection problem that only occured when switching between the
      unencoded area and the encoded area and an attempt was made to select a
      cell already selected in the other area.

  13. Fixed the glyph editors so the grid always comes up as a square which is
      the maximum of the width and height.

  14. Added a new command line and config file option to inhibit the "Really
      Exit?" dialog when exiting.

  15. Improved the help system a bit and added a bit more documentation.

  16. Added a glyph test dialog.

  17. Added a new field that will go to a page containing a particular code.

Version 1.6
===========
  1. Fixed a bug with the '-' characters being removed when the average width
     is updated.

  2. Added a convenience routine to select the whole glyph bitmap in the
     GlyphEditors (Ctrl+A).

  3. Added the XmNmultiClickTime resource to the FontGrid and have it at a
     default of 475 milliseconds (allows more time between clicks than the
     Intrinsics default).

  4. Added some convenience functions to the FontGrid: Button3 copies the
     selection and Button2 pastes the selection starting from the cell where
     the button was pressed.

  5. Changed the "Ctrl+P" accelerator to "Ctrl+O" for switching the glyph
     editor into bitmap copy mode.  The "Ctrl+P" was needed for something
     else.

  6. Added some convenience functions to the Glyph Editor: Ctrl+N will move
     the glyph editor to the next glyph and Ctrl+P will move the Glyph Editor
     to the previous glyph.

  7. The unencoded page is always available now, even if the font has no
     unencoded glyphs.  This allows the unencoded area to be used as a holding
     area.

  8. Fixed things so the glyph editors come up with whatever operation was
     current before they were given a new glyph.  This means they don't force
     Draw mode when they come up any more.

  9. Fixed the annoying behavior of the occasional disappearing selection when
     Copy is being done in the Glyph Editor.

Version 1.5
===========
  1. Added HBF support.

  2. Fixed the filter pattern in the file dialogs to handle any case variation
     in BDF or HBF file extensions.

  3. Added code to change ".hbf" extensions to ".bdf" to avoid overwriting the
     HBF fonts.  Fonts converted from HBF are automatically tagged as being
     modified so they have a better chance of being saved.

  4. Fixed a bug in updating the font name from the properties.

  5. Added support for fonts containing DOS CRLF or Mac CR end-of-line
     characters instead of Unix LF end-of-line.

  6. Fixed a bug with moving selections in the glyph editor.  The descent
     was not being calculated properly.

  7. Fixed a bug with deleting properties that caused the property hash table
     to get out of synchronization with the actual list of font properties.

  8. Added code to get fonts from the X server.

  9. Added the X11R6 "RAW_*" properties so they are at least recognized.

  10. Changed things so that fonts without a filename now have a ".bdf" on the
      end of the generated filename when the "Save Font" dialog comes up.

  11. Fixed a problem that was causing the save dialog to be popped up but
      be ignored when exiting.

  12. Added another font name menu option to update the average width.

  13. Changed things so fonts with lines before the "STARTFONT 2.1" line are
      handled correctly (reported by: <robert@physiol.med.tu-muenchen.de>
      Robert Wilhelm).

Version 1.4
===========
  1. Fixed a bug with COMMENT fields that are immediately followed by a
     newline.

  2. Fixed a bug with checking for the STARTPROPERTIES field too soon.

  3. Fixed things so spaces are now preserved in font properties that are
     of type BDF_ATOM.

  4. Added an item to the View menu to show the changes made when metrics are
     corrected.

  5. Added items to the Edit menu to allow the font XLFD name to be updated
     from the properties and the properties to be updated from the font name.

  6. Added a new dialog that allows editing and saving of the xmbdfed options.
     An Edit menu item was added to bring this dialog up.

  7. Xmbdfed now checks for the ~/.xmbdfedrc file for configuration info
     (see the "xmbdfedrc" file in the distribution).

  8. Fixed a problem with fonts that have glyphs on the last possible page.

  9. Fixed a problem with a previous page calculation from the last page.

  10. Fixed a problem when unencoded glyphs were turned off from the command
      line or from the config file.

  11. Changed the command line parameters around a bit.

  12. Added a dialog to set the Device Width once for Monospace and
      Character-cell spacing fonts.

  13. Changed the glyph editor so the Device Width can only be changed
      directly for Proportional spacing fonts.

  14. Changed the glyph editor resize dialog so the left bearing can only be
      set for Monospace and Proportional spacing fonts.

  15. Fixed a problem with the pathnames for Save As operations.

  16. All Monospace and Proportional fonts are now saved with their glyph
      bitmaps cropped to the minimum rectangle needed to hold the bitmap.

  17. Changed things so Character-cell fonts are padded to the dimensions of
      the font bbx by default, but this can be turned off from the command
      line or the Setup dialog.

Version 1.3
===========
  1. Fixed serious bug with fonts getting corrupted when they are written to a
     file.

  2. Fixed a problem with making XLFD names.

  3. Added a font comment editor.

Version 1.2
===========
  1. Fixed a bug with replacing glyphs.

  2. Added font spacing support to handle character cell fonts better.

Version 1.1
===========
  1. Fixed a number of bugs found in 1.0.

Version 1.0
===========
  1. Initial release.
